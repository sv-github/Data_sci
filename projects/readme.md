## Project Completion

In order to pass this course, General Assembly students **must**:

- Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.
- Complete and submit the final project, including all 5 milestones.

### Grading & Using GitHub in the Classroom

Students should pull in weekly materials released by instructors to their individual repositories. Students can create pull requests to the instructor's course repo for short assignments or homework submission. Instructors can use the public comment feature to confirm receipt and leave high level feedback.

For project submission, students should link to their personal project commits so instructors can view their work. Instructors should in turn link students to a private gist for detailed project feedback and private graded rubrics.
