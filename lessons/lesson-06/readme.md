DS | Lesson 6

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Explain the bias-variance tradeoff as it applies to modeling
- Define data modeling and simple linear regression
- Build a linear regression model using a dataset that meets the linearity assumption using the sci-kit learn library
- Understand and identify multicollinearity in a multiple regression.

### INSTRUCTOR PREP
*Before this lesson, instructors will need to:*

- Review [Final Project pt 1](../../projects/final-projects/01-lightning-talk/readme.md)

## Opening (5 mins)
#### Where are we in the data science workflow?

The data we are working with for this lesson has been **acquired** and **parsed**. Through today's process we will be **refining** the data and **building** models, using some plotting to **represent** the results.


<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion (5 mins)

- How do you dummy a categorical variable?
    - How do you avoid a singular matrix?
- What is a single linear regression?
- What makes multi-variable regressions more useful?
    - What challenges do they introduce?
