DS | Lesson 7

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Define regularization, bias, and error metrics for regression problems
- Evaluate model fit by using loss functions including mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error
- Select regression methods based on fit and complexity

### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Understand goodness of fit (r-squared)
- Measure statistical significance of features
- Recall what a _residual_ is
- Implement an sklearn estimator to predict a target variable
